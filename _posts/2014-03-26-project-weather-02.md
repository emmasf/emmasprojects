#Weather App: Research

A fellow MFA student and I decided to work together starting this week. Maybe it's because our thesis show goes up in a few days and we need some moral support!

She is very interested in mapping APIs, specifically MapBox. She's also going to be moving to San Francisco this fall for work. We decided to create a map of San Francisco, and what better content than its wacky weather.

She's going to tackle the mapping side of things while I get a handle on weather. Here's what I've learned so far:

- Weather Underground had an extensive documentation. 
- It allows for hourly reports from a variety of sources within each neighborhood of SF. 
- However, there's no specific data variable for fog (it's in the mix with cloudy, sunny, etc, even though it exists in addition to these conditions), nor easy way to calculate it.
