#Structure and Wireframes

This week, I did some planning and analysis for the Enoch Pratt Library website.

I like to draw wireframes by hand using tracing paper, both for ease of thinking and to make sure no one gets confused about visual design. No mater how simple the computer sketch, I find that people start thinking about the hierarchy, the weight of things on the page, and how things move as much as they do the content and functionality.
