#This Very Website

Is this a frame or a project in and of itself? You decide.

I spent the last few weeks of class learning how to use Gitub's Jekyll to create a website: this one. 

This beginner's dabbling in template engines was not easy. Even more than with Javascript, my triumphs were often overshadowed by despair at my inability to troubleshoot. I persevered, and this site was born.

Long live {{ }}
